    In our Entrepreneurship Project for the Computer Science Essentials course, our team: Aditya, Arshan, Vishwak, and Mihir strived to create an app that would help students time manage by incorporating features such as schedules, timers, stopwatches, study music, organizers, task completion recorders, and more. Around half of the project was completing certain assignemnts that would help us organize our ideas and incorporate them into our app. We used the ideas from the ChatGPT ideation to use in our app, we used the Needs and Needs assignment to discuss the desires of different types of users and coding based on our ideas we wrote; In the Quadrant Diagram Evaluation, we prioritized some problem that users encounter on a daily basis to solve using our app. We addressed the first few problems with the time we had. After completing the assignments, during this three week project, our entire team collaborated and brainstormred different ideas to incorporate into our project. At first, we wanted to use APIs and a login system where users can have their separate accounts, making their data private to other users, however, we learned that this was complicated and would take a long time to accomplish. Due to this, we improvised and changed our original plan. After assigning roles and agreeing upon our final idea, our team got to work. My role in this project was being a Developer alongside Arshan and Vishwak. Arshan and I worked on the study page of our code(timer, stopwatch, music) by collaborating and helping each other out. The main teamwork factor was between Arshan and I as we constantly worked side by side, testing, coding, and debugging. Not everything was smooth sailing for us because we encountered many problems that would consume time. Arshan and I overthough the timer and stopwatch, making it break the code. Due to this, we tried to keep it simple by constantly testing and debugging the code. In addition to all of this, I learned a lot about HTML and JavaScript throughout the project. Coding alongside Arshan helped me learn and know the proper syntax for both HTML and JavaScript as well as various other functions, methods, procedures, and more. At the end of the project, I was proud to say that I contributed to the project as well as learnt a lot from it.

    In this project, Arshan and I strived to create an entertaining ping pong game. As we were beginner coders at the time, we settled upon using MIT App Inventor to complete our app, rather than the convenient HTML and JavaScript. The first thing we worked on was getting the ball(sprite) to move each time the paddle had connected with the ball. At first this was a challenge as we didn't know how we could make the ball go in a speciic direction after colliding with the paddle. However, after using if statements and other functions, we programmed a functional ball for our Ping Pong Game. We then tested and debugged the ball because it would sometimes get stuck. Everything after this was simple; we worked on the paddle to move, a point system, a reseet system, and most importantly, a feature where whenever the ball bounces on the paddle or the wall, it will increase speed slightly, making getting higher scores/points more difficult. In this project as well, Arshan and I worked side by side, collaborating with each other to make the game functional. Although there were challenges we faced in creating this app in MIT App Inventor, we still perservered and spent quality time completing the app. In addition to all of this, I learned a lot while creating this app. I learned more about sprites and how we can cause movement using different functions/methods/procedures. Most importantly, I learned that teamwork is crucial in completing a difficult task, because if it weren't for Arshan helping me and me helping Arshan, we wouldn't have even been close to completing this goal of ours.
