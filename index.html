    <p>Doctor, Engineer, Construction Worker, Dentist, or Pharmacist? So many interesting and fun jobs to choose from; so why did I choose to become a software engineer? Well, I enjoy the subject of math and solving calculus type problems. With this as a hobby, I found an interest in computer science because it is mainly focused on applying many methods to solve real-life problems. My plan to achieve my dream of becoming a software engineer is to practice coding as a hobby and make it something I will do regularly and on my own rather than something that I am forced to do. This will get me more exposed to coding and help me develop a greater passion for it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My main strength is math. Before I even started going to school, my parents had taught me addition and subraction. With this early exposure to math, I was able to get ahead of most students in math. I was able to learn and master concepts such as multiplication and division in first grade itself. Through extra-cirricular classes and the support of my parents, I am currently learning Pre-Calculus and Trigonometry in 9th grade. Now, my personality: I am an ongoing and energetic teen that enjoys exploring new and different things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Fitting into high scchool, I haven't done much volunteering yet. However, I am planning to join more clubs and consider creating one myself. Next year, in our new campus, I am aiming to get over 100 volunteer hours by doing things such as fundraisers to help make our in-progress school even better. Although it may not be much, a few dollars can truly benefit the school. In addition, my goal is to use my knowledge in coding to create an app to help the Emerald High School Staff complete certain tasks, to make their job easier. Outside of school, I am enrolled in extra-cirricular classes that focus mainly on the subjects of Math and English. I am also an active member of a Debate Club that was recommended to me by my English Tutor. In school, I am part of the Chess Club, A.I. Club, and I am currently enrolling for two more. From projects, presentations, and activities in schoool, I have discovered that I am a great team player (I work well with others).<p>
